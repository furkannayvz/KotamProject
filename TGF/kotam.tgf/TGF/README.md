TGF (Traffic Generator Function) is a sophisticated simulator designed to mimic real-world data, voice, and SMS transactions.
The system fetches MSISDNs from Hazelcast, generates random consumption data, and efficiently sends these transactions
to the Charging Function (CHF) using Akka.

TGF is built with multi-threading capabilities, allowing it to run multiple Java threads simultaneously for enhanced performance.
It also includes a console-based user interface, providing a set of commands to monitor and control traffic flow effectively.
For logging, TGF utilizes Log4j, ensuring that all activities and transactions are accurately logged for later analysis.

This project serves as an invaluable tool for testing and simulating telecom transaction environments,
offering a robust platform for developers and testers to assess system performance under various conditions.
